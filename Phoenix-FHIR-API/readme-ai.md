# Phoenix FHIR Transformation Layer

## Project Vision

This project aims to create a comprehensive transformation layer that converts legacy healthcare data (defined in our swagger.json) into fully compliant FHIR R4 resources for use in a presentation-only layer. The transformation layer serves as a bridge between our existing data sources and modern healthcare applications, enabling seamless integration with FHIR-compatible systems without modifying the underlying data storage.

## Core Objectives

1. **Complete FHIR R4 Resource Mapping**: Transform all relevant legacy healthcare endpoints (defined in swagger.json) into standard FHIR R4 resources using the Firely SDK.

2. **Real-Time Transformation**: Enable on-the-fly conversion of data between the legacy system and FHIR format without storing duplicate data.

3. **Presentation Layer Support**: Provide a clean, consistent API that can be consumed by a presentation-only layer, allowing for modern UI development without direct knowledge of the legacy data structures.

4. **FHIR Compliance**: Ensure all transformed resources fully comply with FHIR R4 standards through rigorous validation.

## Multiple Tier Architecture

Our solution implements a clean, multi-tiered architecture to ensure proper separation of concerns and maintainable code:

### 1. Data Access Tier
- **Legacy API Integration**: Connects to existing healthcare endpoints defined in swagger.json
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access through repository interfaces
- **No Direct SQL**: All data access occurs through the defined API endpoints
- **Data Retrieval Services**: Specialized services for fetching specific types of healthcare data

### 2. Transformation Tier
- **Mappers**: Dedicated components that transform legacy models to FHIR resources
- **Bidirectional Mapping**: Support for both read and write operations
- **Field-Level Transformations**: Explicit mapping between source and target fields
- **Extension Handling**: Proper management of FHIR extensions for non-standard data

### 3. Validation Tier
- **FHIR Validators**: Ensures all resources comply with FHIR R4 specifications
- **Business Rule Validation**: Additional validation for domain-specific rules
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and management

### 4. API Tier
- **RESTful Endpoints**: FHIR-compliant API endpoints
- **Resource Controllers**: Dedicated controllers for each FHIR resource type
- **Operation Support**: Implementation of standard FHIR operations
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization mechanisms

### 5. Presentation Tier (Consumer)
- **UI Components**: Modern web interface consuming FHIR resources
- **No Business Logic**: Presentation layer focuses solely on display and user interaction
- **FHIR Client**: Communicates with the API tier using standard FHIR interactions

### Data Flow
1. **Request Initiation**: User interaction triggers a request from the Presentation Tier
2. **API Handling**: The API Tier receives and processes the request
3. **Data Retrieval**: The Data Access Tier fetches required data from legacy endpoints
4. **Transformation**: The Transformation Tier converts legacy data to FHIR format
5. **Validation**: The Validation Tier ensures FHIR compliance
6. **Response**: The API Tier returns validated FHIR resources to the Presentation Tier
7. **Rendering**: The Presentation Tier displays the data to the user

This clean separation ensures:
- **Maintainability**: Each tier can be modified independently
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: Tiers can be scaled independently based on load
- **Evolvability**: The system can adapt to changes in either the legacy system or FHIR standards

## Technical Approach

### 1. Incremental Resource Implementation

We're following a methodical, incremental approach to building out the FHIR resources:

- **One Resource at a Time**: Starting with Patient and expanding to other resources in a prioritized order
- **Thorough Testing**: Each resource is fully tested before moving to the next
- **Field-Level Mapping**: Explicit mapping between legacy fields and FHIR attributes

### 2. No Mock Data Policy

- All data is sourced directly from the legacy API endpoints defined in swagger.json
- No synthetic or mock data is used in the transformation process
- Every FHIR resource represents actual data from the legacy system

### 3. Dual Validation Strategy

- **Primary Validation**: Using Firely SDK's built-in validation capabilities
- **Secondary Verification**: Additional custom validation to ensure compliance with specific implementation guides
- **US Core Compliance**: Where applicable, resources are validated against US Core profiles

### 4. Swagger-to-FHIR Mapping Framework

The core of this project is a robust mapping framework that:

1. Consumes the legacy API endpoints defined in swagger.json
2. Applies field-level transformations to convert legacy data models to FHIR resources
3. Validates the resulting FHIR resources against the standard
4. Exposes the transformed resources through a RESTful API

## Clean Data Flow Principles

Our architecture adheres to the following principles to ensure clean data flow:

1. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in a predictable direction through the tiers
2. **Immutable Data Transfer**: Data objects are not modified once created, new objects are created for transformations
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between tiers
4. **Dependency Inversion**: Higher tiers do not depend on lower tier implementations
5. **Explicit Transformations**: All data mapping is explicit and traceable
6. **Error Propagation**: Errors are caught at the appropriate tier and propagated with context
7. **Stateless Operations**: API operations are stateless for scalability
8. **Idempotent Requests**: API calls with the same parameters always produce the same results

- Search parameter support

### Phase 5: Optimization & Security
- Performance optimization
- Security implementation
- Comprehensive testing

## Presentation Layer Integration

The transformed FHIR resources will be consumed by a presentation-only layer that:

1. Makes API calls to the transformation layer
2. Receives standardized FHIR resources
3. Renders the data in a user-friendly interface
4. Supports CRUD operations through the transformation layer

This separation of concerns allows the presentation layer to focus solely on user experience without needing to understand the complexities of the legacy data structures or the FHIR transformation process.

## Benefits

1. **Standardization**: All healthcare data is accessible through standardized FHIR interfaces
2. **Interoperability**: Easy integration with other FHIR-compatible systems
3. **Modernization**: Legacy systems can be accessed through modern APIs without migration
4. **Future-Proofing**: New presentation layers can be developed independently of the data layer
5. **Incremental Adoption**: FHIR resources can be implemented and adopted one at a time
6. **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns for maintainability and scalability

## Technical Stack

- **.NET 6**: Core application framework
- **Firely SDK (Hl7.Fhir.R4)**: FHIR implementation and validation
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Definition of legacy API endpoints
- **RESTful API**: Interface for the presentation layer
- **Dependency Injection**: For loose coupling between components
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all tiers
